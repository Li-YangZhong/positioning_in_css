        This paragraph does <em>not</em> establish a containing block for any of
        its descendant elements that are absolutely positioned. Therefore, the
        absolutely positioned <b>boldface</b> element it contains will be
        positioned with respect to the initial containing block.
    </p>
    <p class="contain">
        Thanks to <code>position: relative</code>, this paragraph establishes a
        containing block for any of its descendant elements that are absolutely
        positioned. Since there is such an element-- <em>that is to say, <b>a
                boldfaced element that is absolutely positioned,</b> placed with respect
            to its containing block (the paragraph)</em>, it will appear within the
        element box generated by the paragraph.
